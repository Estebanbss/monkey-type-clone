# Monkey Type Clone but is a Parrot

This project is a web-based game that replicates the functionality of the popular "Monkey Type" game but with a playful theme featuring a parrot. Players are presented with a series of random words and are required to type them as accurately and quickly as possible. The game provides feedback on typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy.
